# HW4_Code_Quiz

### **Objective**

The objective for this fourth homework assignment was to create a timed multiple choice quiz with a high score list. The JavaScript begins when the user clicks the Begin Quiz button. It'll take the user through several multiple choice questions. If the user answers correctly, they move on to the next questions. If the user answers incorrectly, then a 10 second penalty is deducted from the timer. Upon completion of all questions, or the timer reaching 0, the user is alerted the quiz is complete and prompted to enter their initials. The initials and score are then added to a high score page. The high score page allows the user to restart the quiz or clear high scores.

### **Challenges**

This assignment really pushed me with the use of JavaScript and using local storage to save the user's name and score. I had hoped to be able to store multiple initials and scores in local storage as an object with JSON.stringify and JSON.parse, but I was not able to figure that part out. I hope to develop a better understanding of that and may update the quiz when I can.
